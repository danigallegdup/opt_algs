### Suggested Reading Strategy:
1. **Start with Chapter 7** for a strong foundation on flow problems, matchings, and related graph theory.
2. **Move to Chapters 11 and 13** for approximation and randomized algorithms.
3. **Review Chapter 3** if basic graph concepts need reinforcement.

These chapters and sections closely align with the course's focus on flow networks, matchings, optimization, and probabilistic approaches. Let me know if you need help navigating specific sections or summaries!
