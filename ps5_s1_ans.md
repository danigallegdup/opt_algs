### Solution for Question 1: Minimum (s, t)-Cut with the Fewest Edges

---

#### **Problem Restatement**
Design an algorithm to find the minimum (s, t)-cut in a flow network \( G = (V, E) \) that minimizes the **number of edges** among all possible minimum cuts.

---

### **Solution Outline**

#### **Key Concepts**
1. **Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem**:
   - The value of the maximum flow in a network equals the capacity of the minimum cut separating \( s \) from \( t \).
2. **Residual Graph**:
   - Constructed after computing the maximum flow, the residual graph identifies reachable and non-reachable vertices from \( s \) under the current flow.

---

#### **Algorithm**

1. **Compute Maximum Flow**:
   - Use any standard max-flow algorithm (e.g., Edmonds-Karp, Ford-Fulkerson, or Push-Relabel) to compute the maximum flow \( f \) in the network.

2. **Build Residual Graph**:
   - Construct the residual graph \( G^r \) based on the computed flow \( f \):
     - Include edges with remaining capacity \( > 0 \).

3. **Identify Reachable Vertices**:
   - Perform a BFS or DFS starting from \( s \) in \( G^r \).
   - Let \( S \) be the set of vertices reachable from \( s \), and let \( T = V \setminus S \).

4. **Find Minimum Cut Edges**:
   - Identify all edges \( (u, v) \) such that \( u \in S \) and \( v \in T \). These edges form the minimum cut.
   - For each edge \( (u, v) \), check if its removal minimizes the cut size and reduces the total number of edges.

5. **Optimize for Fewest Edges**:
   - Among all minimum cuts with the same capacity, select the cut with the smallest number of edges.

### **Pseudocode**

```python
def min_cut_with_fewest_edges(graph, s, t):
    # Step 1: Compute max flow
    flow, residual_graph = max_flow(graph, s, t)
    
    # Step 2: Find reachable vertices in the residual graph
    S = bfs(residual_graph, s)  # Reachable vertices from s
    T = set(graph.vertices) - S  # Non-reachable vertices
    
    # Step 3: Identify minimum cut edges
    min_cut_edges = []
    for u in S:
        for v in graph.neighbors(u):
            if v in T and graph.capacity[u][v] == 0:  # Edge fully used
                min_cut_edges.append((u, v))
    
    # Step 4: Return edges in the minimum cut
    return min_cut_edges
```

### **Complexity Analysis**
1. **Max-Flow Computation**:
   - \( O(VE^2) \) for Edmonds-Karp or \( O(E^2 \sqrt{V}) \) for Push-Relabel.
2. **BFS for Reachable Vertices**:
   - \( O(V + E) \).
3. **Identifying Cut Edges**:
   - \( O(E) \).

**Total Complexity**:
- Dominated by the max-flow algorithm: \( O(VE^2) \) or \( O(E^2 \sqrt{V}) \).

---

### **Example**

#### **Input**:
- Graph \( G \):
  - \( V = \{s, a, b, t\} \),
  - Edges: \( (s, a, 10), (s, b, 5), (a, b, 15), (a, t, 10), (b, t, 10) \).

#### **Steps**:
1. Compute max flow:
   - Maximum flow \( f = 15 \).

2. Construct residual graph:
   - Remaining capacities:
     - \( (s, a, 0), (s, b, 0), (a, b, 5), (a, t, 0), (b, t, 5) \).

3. BFS from \( s \):
   - \( S = \{s, b\} \), \( T = \{a, t\} \).

4. Identify minimum cut edges:
   - Edges crossing from \( S \) to \( T \):
     - \( (s, a) \), \( (b, t) \).

5. Minimize edge count:
   - Select \( (s, a) \) and \( (b, t) \), ensuring the minimum number of edges.
