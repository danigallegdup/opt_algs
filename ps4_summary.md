### Summary of Problem Set 4 Solutions and Relevant Lecture Topics

#### **Question 1: Lovász Local Lemma (Symmetric Form)**

**Problem**:
Given \( n \) events \( A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n \) such that:
- \( P[A_i] \leq p \) for all \( i \),
- Each \( A_i \) is independent of all but at most \( d \) other events.

Prove that if \( ep(d+1) \leq 1 \), then there exists a nonzero probability that none of the events \( A_i \) occur.

---

**Solution**:
1. **Application of Lovász Local Lemma (LLL)**:
   - Symmetric LLL conditions:
     - \( P(A_i) \leq p \) for all \( i \),
     - \( p \cdot e \cdot (d + 1) \leq 1 \).
   - Guarantees a positive probability that none of the events \( A_i \) occur.

2. **Steps**:
   - Compute dependencies \( d \) for each event.
   - Ensure \( ep(d+1) \leq 1 \) is satisfied.
   - Conclude that the dependency structure and event probabilities allow for a configuration where no \( A_i \) occurs.

---

**Relevant Lecture Topic**:
- **Lovász Local Lemma**:
  - Probabilistic method for sparse dependency structures.
  - Symmetric and asymmetric forms for event dependencies.

#### **Question 2: Edge Coloring of \( K_n \)**

**Problem**:
Show that if the inequality:
\[
4 \binom{k}{2} \binom{n-2}{k-2} 2^{1-\binom{k}{2}} \leq 1
\]
is satisfied, it is possible to color the edges of the complete graph \( K_n \) with two colors such that no monochromatic \( K_k \) subgraph exists.

---

**Solution**:
1. **Interpretation**:
   - \( K_k \): A clique of size \( k \) in \( K_n \).
   - The inequality ensures that the probability of having a monochromatic \( K_k \) in a random edge coloring is small.

2. **Steps**:
   - Use the probabilistic method:
     - Assign two colors to edges randomly.
     - Compute the expected number of monochromatic \( K_k \) subgraphs.
   - If the inequality is satisfied, the expected number of monochromatic \( K_k \) is less than 1, implying there exists a valid coloring.

---

**Relevant Lecture Topic**:
- **Probabilistic Method and Edge Coloring**:
  - Random assignments to avoid monochromatic substructures.
  - Expected value arguments in graph theory.

#### **Question 3: Hypergraph 2-Colorability**

**Problem**:
Use the Lovász Local Lemma to prove the following:
1. **(a)** A \( k \)-uniform hypergraph \( H \) with maximum degree \( \Delta \leq \frac{2^{k-3}}{k-1} \) is 2-colorable.
2. **(b)** A \( k \)-uniform \( k \)-regular hypergraph is 2-colorable for \( k \geq 9 \).
3. **(c)** For a non-uniform hypergraph \( H \) where every edge \( e \) satisfies:
   \[
   \sum_{f \neq e, f \cap e \neq \emptyset} 2^{-|f|} \leq \frac{1}{8},
   \]
   \( H \) is 2-colorable.

---

**Solution**:
1. **(a)** Uniform Hypergraph with Maximum Degree:
   - Apply LLL:
     - Let \( A_e \) denote the event that edge \( e \) is monochromatic.
     - \( P(A_e) \leq 2^{1-k} \).
     - Ensure dependency \( d \) satisfies \( 2^{1-k} \cdot e \cdot \Delta \leq 1 \).

2. **(b)** Regular Hypergraph:
   - \( k \)-regular implies \( \Delta = k \).
   - Use (a) to deduce 2-colorability for \( k \geq 9 \).

3. **(c)** Non-Uniform Hypergraph:
   - Extend LLL to handle varying edge sizes:
     - Dependency sum condition \( \sum_{f \neq e} 2^{-|f|} \leq \frac{1}{8} \) ensures sparse interactions.

---

**Relevant Lecture Topic**:
- **Hypergraphs and 2-Colorability**:
  - Application of LLL to color hypergraph vertices.
  - Handling uniform and non-uniform edges with dependency constraints.

---

#### **Question 4: Independent Sets in Graphs**

**Problem**:
Given a graph \( G = (V, E) \) with maximum degree \( \Delta \), and a partition \( V = V_1 \cup V_2 \cup \dots \cup V_r \) such that \( |V_i| \geq 2e\Delta \), prove there exists an independent set containing one vertex from each \( V_i \).

---

**Solution**:
1. **Random Selection**:
   - Pick one vertex randomly from each \( V_i \).
   - Probability that the selected set is independent depends on \( \Delta \).

2. **Expected Value Argument**:
   - Compute the probability of avoiding edges using the partition size and vertex degree.
   - Use the union bound and Lovász Local Lemma to guarantee the existence of such a set.

---

**Relevant Lecture Topic**:
- **Independent Sets and Probabilistic Methods**:
  - Random selection and union bound arguments.
  - Application of LLL to guarantee sparse structures.
