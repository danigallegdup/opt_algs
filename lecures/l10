#### **Topic: Linear Programming (LP)**

---

### **1. Introduction to Linear Programming**
- **Definition**:
  - LP is a technique to solve optimization problems where both the objective function and constraints are linear.
  - Objective: Maximize or minimize a linear function subject to linear constraints.

- **Historical Milestones**:
  1. **Simplex Method (1947)**:
     - Developed by George Dantzig.
     - Efficient in practice but does not guarantee polynomial-time performance.
  2. **Ellipsoid Method (1979)**:
     - Proposed by Khachiyan.
     - Demonstrates that LP can be solved in polynomial time.

### **2. Problem Formulation in LP**
#### **2.1 Types of LP Problems**
1. **Feasibility Problem**:
   - Determine if a solution \( x \) exists such that:
     \[
     Ax \geq b
     \]
2. **Optimization Problem**:
   - Maximize or minimize a linear objective function:
     \[
     \text{Maximize } c^\top x \text{ subject to } Ax \geq b.
     \]

#### **2.2 Feasibility**
- To determine if a system of inequalities is feasible:
  - Identify contradictions (e.g., \( 0 \geq 1 \)).
  - Use **positive linear combinations** of inequalities to derive contradictions.

#### **2.3 Farkas' Lemma**
- **Statement**:
  - If \( Ax \geq b \) has no solution, there exists \( \lambda \geq 0 \) such that:
    \[
    \lambda^\top A = 0, \quad \lambda^\top b = 1.
    \]
- **Proof Outline**:
  - Combine inequalities using non-negative multipliers to derive contradictions.

### **3. Complexity of Linear Programming**
#### **3.1 LP in NP and co-NP**
- **Theorem**:
  - If \( Ax \geq b \) has no solution, there exists a rational proof of infeasibility with bitlength polynomial in the input size \( L \).
- **Implications**:
  - LP is in the complexity class \( \text{NP} \cap \text{co-NP} \).

---

### **4. Solving Linear Programs**
#### **4.1 Bounded Feasible Region**
- **Definition**:
  - A bounded feasible region forms a convex polytope.
- **Properties**:
  - Any vertex of the polytope corresponds to a solution defined by \( n \) linear equalities.
  - The bitlength of the solution is bounded by the bitlength of the input data.

#### **4.2 Unbounded Feasible Region**
- **Handling Unbounded Regions**:
  - Introduce box constraints \( -B \leq x_i \leq B \) where \( B \) is chosen to ensure feasibility.
  - This ensures the region is bounded without excluding valid solutions.

---

### **5. Search vs Decision**
#### **5.1 Search Problem**
- **Objective**:
  - Given \( Ax \geq b \), find a feasible \( x \) using a decision oracle.
- **Process**:
  - Iteratively fix variables (\( x_1 = 0, x_2 = 0, \ldots \)) and check feasibility using the oracle.

#### **5.2 Optimization Problem**
- **Objective**:
  - Maximize \( c^\top x \) subject to \( Ax \geq b \).
- **Approach**:
  - Use binary search to find the largest \( t \) such that:
    \[
    c^\top x \geq t
    \]
  - Ensure feasibility of \( x \) for each \( t \).

---

### **6. Summary**
- LP is a foundational tool in optimization with applications in feasibility testing and optimization problems.
- Farkas' Lemma and duality principles provide theoretical guarantees for solving LPs.
- LP is computationally efficient, belonging to the class \( \text{NP} \cap \text{co-NP} \).
