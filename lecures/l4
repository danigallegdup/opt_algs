### Detailed Notes: CS4234 Optimization Algorithms - Lecture 4
#### **Topic: Conjunctive Normal Form Satisfaction (CNF-SAT)**

---

### **1. Introduction to CNF-SAT**
- **Definition**:
  - A **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** is defined as:
    - \( X \): Set of variables.
    - \( D \): Domains of variables.
    - \( C \): Constraints on variables.
  - The goal is to assign values to variables such that all constraints are satisfied.

- **CNF-SAT**:
  - Special CSP where:
    - Variables \( X \) are Boolean (\( \{True, False\} \)).
    - Constraints are **clauses** in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), i.e., a conjunction of disjunctions of literals.

- **Key Terms**:
  - **Literal**: A variable or its negation (\( x \) or \( \neg x \)).
  - **Clause**: Disjunction of literals (\( x \lor \neg y \lor z \)).
  - **Problem**: Find an assignment of Boolean values that satisfies all clauses.

- **Complexity**:
  - CNF-SAT is NP-complete and NP-hard, even for special cases like 3-SAT.

### **2. Weighted CNF-SAT**
- **Definition**:
  - Each clause \( C_i \) has an associated weight \( w_i \).
  - Goal: Maximize the sum of weights of satisfied clauses.

- **Variants**:
  - **k-CNF-SAT**:
    - Each clause has exactly \( k \) literals.
  - **General Weighted CNF-SAT**:
    - Clauses may have varying numbers of literals.

---

### **3. Approximation Algorithms for Weighted k-CNF-SAT**

#### **3.1 Randomized Algorithm**
- **Algorithm**:
  1. Assign \( True \) or \( False \) to each variable with equal probability (0.5).
  2. Compute the sum of weights of satisfied clauses.

- **Performance**:
  - Expected value of satisfied weights:
    \[
    E[w^*] = (1 - \frac{1}{2^k}) \cdot OPT
    \]
  - Approximation ratio: \( (1 - \frac{1}{2^k}) \).

#### **3.2 Deterministic Algorithm**
- **Key Idea**:
  - Use the law of total expectation to iteratively fix variables while maximizing conditional expectation.

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Initialize all variables as unfixed.
  2. For each variable \( x_i \):
     - Compute \( E[w^* | x_i = True] \) and \( E[w^* | x_i = False] \).
     - Fix \( x_i \) to the value that maximizes conditional expectation.
     - Update the problem by substituting the fixed value.
  3. Return the sum of weights of satisfied clauses.

- **Performance**:
  - Approximation ratio: \( (1 - \frac{1}{2^k}) \).

### **4. Approximation for General Weighted CNF-SAT**

#### **4.1 Randomized Algorithm for Positive Unit Clauses**
- **Assumption**:
  - If a clause contains a single literal (\( k=1 \)), it is positive (\( x_i \), not \( \neg x_i \)).

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Assign \( True \) to each variable with probability \( p > 0.5 \), where \( p = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \).
  2. Compute the sum of weights of satisfied clauses.

- **Performance**:
  - Approximation ratio: \( \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \approx 0.618 \).

#### **4.2 General Weighted CNF-SAT**
- **Key Idea**:
  - Bias assignments based on clause weights and maximize the probability of satisfying high-weight clauses.

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Use the same randomized algorithm but adjust weights of negative clauses.
  2. Run the algorithm iteratively for \( p = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \).

- **Performance**:
  - Approximation ratio: \( \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \approx 0.618 \).

### **5. Linear Programming Formulation**
- **Goal**:
  - Maximize \( \sum w_i \cdot y_i \), where \( y_i = 1 \) if clause \( C_i \) is satisfied, \( 0 \) otherwise.

- **Constraints**:
  1. \( x_i \in \{0, 1\} \): Boolean variables.
  2. \( y_i \in \{0, 1\} \): Clause satisfaction indicators.
  3. For each clause \( C_i = (l_{i1} \lor l_{i2} \lor ... \lor l_{ik}) \):
     \[
     \sum \text{(satisfied literals in } C_i) \geq y_i
     \]

- **Relaxation**:
  - Allow \( x_i, y_i \in [0, 1] \) for solving as a linear program (LP).

- **Solution**:
  - Solve LP to get fractional solutions.
  - Use randomized rounding to obtain integer solutions.

---

### **6. Summary of Results**
- **Weighted k-CNF-SAT**:
  - Randomized and deterministic algorithms with approximation ratio \( (1 - \frac{1}{2^k}) \).
- **Positive Unit Clauses**:
  - Approximation ratio: \( \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \).
- **General CNF-SAT**:
  - LP relaxation and rounding yield \( \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \)-approximation.
