### Solution for Question 2: Determining Unique Max-Flow and Min-Cut

---

#### **Problem Restatement**
1. **(a)** Determine whether the given flow network contains a **unique max-flow**.
2. **(b)** Determine whether the given flow network contains a **unique minimum (s, t)-cut**.

---

### **Solution**

#### **Part (a): Unique Max-Flow**

**Key Idea**:
- A flow network has a unique maximum flow if the residual graph after achieving the max-flow contains **no augmenting paths**.

**Steps**:
1. **Compute the Maximum Flow**:
   - Use a standard algorithm (e.g., Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp) to compute the max-flow \( f \) of the network.

2. **Construct the Residual Graph**:
   - After computing \( f \), construct the residual graph \( G^r \):
     - For each edge \( (u, v) \), the residual capacity is:
       \[
       c^r(u, v) = c(u, v) - f(u, v),
       \]
       where \( c(u, v) \) is the original capacity and \( f(u, v) \) is the flow.

3. **Check for Augmenting Paths**:
   - Perform a BFS or DFS from \( s \) to \( t \) in the residual graph.
   - If no augmenting paths exist (i.e., no path with positive residual capacity), the max-flow is **unique**.

**Conditions for Uniqueness**:
- If there are no multiple flow distributions along augmenting paths that achieve the same max-flow value, the flow is unique.

#### **Part (b): Unique Minimum (s, t)-Cut**

**Key Idea**:
- A minimum (s, t)-cut is unique if there is only one way to partition the vertices \( V \) into two disjoint sets \( S \) and \( T \) such that:
  - The capacity of the cut is equal to the max-flow.

**Steps**:
1. **Compute the Maximum Flow**:
   - Use the max-flow value \( f \) computed in Part (a).

2. **Find All Minimum Cuts**:
   - Perform a BFS or DFS from \( s \) in the residual graph to find the set of reachable vertices \( S \).
   - \( T = V \setminus S \) forms one minimum cut.

3. **Check for Multiple Cuts**:
   - Check if there are other partitions of \( V \) into \( S' \) and \( T' \) with the same cut capacity:
     - For each edge \( (u, v) \) in the graph:
       - If \( u \in S' \) and \( v \in T' \), verify that the cut capacity matches the max-flow.

**Conditions for Uniqueness**:
- The minimum cut is unique if there is only one set of edges that separates \( S \) and \( T \) with the total cut capacity equal to \( f \).

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Unique Max-Flow**

**Graph**:
- \( V = \{s, a, b, t\} \),
- Edges and capacities:
  - \( (s, a, 10), (s, b, 10), (a, t, 10), (b, t, 10) \).

**Steps**:
1. Compute max-flow:
   - Maximum flow \( f = 20 \).

2. Residual graph:
   - After flow, no augmenting paths remain.

**Result**:
- The max-flow is unique.

---

#### **Example 2: Unique Minimum Cut**

**Graph**:
- Same graph as above.

**Steps**:
1. Compute the minimum cut:
   - Perform BFS in the residual graph:
     - \( S = \{s, a\} \), \( T = \{b, t\} \).
   - Cut edges: \( \{(a, t), (b, t)\} \).

2. Verify uniqueness:
   - No alternative partition achieves the same capacity.

**Result**:
- The minimum cut is unique.
