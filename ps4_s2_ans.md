### Solution for Question 2: Edge Coloring of \( K_n \)

---

#### **Problem Restatement**
Show that if the inequality:
\[
4 \binom{k}{2} \binom{n-2}{k-2} 2^{1-\binom{k}{2}} \leq 1,
\]
is satisfied, it is possible to color the edges of the complete graph \( K_n \) with two colors such that no monochromatic \( K_k \) subgraph exists.

---

### **Solution**

#### **Key Idea**
Use the **probabilistic method** to prove that a valid 2-coloring of the edges of \( K_n \) exists where no \( K_k \) subgraph is monochromatic.

---

### **1. Definitions and Notation**
1. **Complete Graph \( K_n \)**:
   - \( K_n \) has \( \binom{n}{2} \) edges.

2. **Edge Coloring**:
   - Each edge is assigned one of two colors, say **red** or **blue**.

3. **Monochromatic \( K_k \)**:
   - A \( K_k \) subgraph is monochromatic if all \( \binom{k}{2} \) edges in the subgraph have the same color.

4. **Goal**:
   - Show that if the inequality holds, then the probability of any \( K_k \) being monochromatic is less than 1, implying the existence of a valid coloring.

---

### **2. Probabilistic Argument**

#### **Step 1: Random Coloring**
- Randomly assign each edge in \( K_n \) to be red or blue with equal probability (\( P(\text{red}) = P(\text{blue}) = \frac{1}{2} \)).

#### **Step 2: Monochromatic \( K_k \)**
- Consider a specific \( K_k \) subgraph:
  - It has \( \binom{k}{2} \) edges.
  - Probability that it is entirely red:
    \[
    P(\text{red}) = 2^{-\binom{k}{2}}.
    \]
  - Similarly, probability that it is entirely blue:
    \[
    P(\text{blue}) = 2^{-\binom{k}{2}}.
    \]
  - Total probability that it is monochromatic:
    \[
    P(\text{monochromatic}) = P(\text{red}) + P(\text{blue}) = 2 \cdot 2^{-\binom{k}{2}} = 2^{1-\binom{k}{2}}.
    \]

#### **Step 3: Expected Number of Monochromatic \( K_k \) Subgraphs**
- Number of \( K_k \) subgraphs in \( K_n \):
  \[
  \binom{n}{k}.
  \]
- Expected number of monochromatic \( K_k \) subgraphs:
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[\text{monochromatic } K_k] = \binom{n}{k} \cdot 2^{1-\binom{k}{2}}.
  \]

---

### **3. Bounding the Expected Value**

#### **Inequality Simplification**
The inequality:
\[
4 \binom{k}{2} \binom{n-2}{k-2} 2^{1-\binom{k}{2}} \leq 1,
\]
can be interpreted as ensuring the expected number of monochromatic \( K_k \) subgraphs is less than 1:
\[
\mathbb{E}[\text{monochromatic } K_k] \leq 1.
\]

#### **Why the Bound Ensures a Valid Coloring**
- If \( \mathbb{E}[\text{monochromatic } K_k] < 1 \), there exists at least one 2-coloring of the edges where no \( K_k \) is monochromatic (by the probabilistic method).

---

### **4. Example**
Let \( n = 10 \), \( k = 4 \):
- Compute the terms:
  - \( \binom{k}{2} = 6 \), \( \binom{n-2}{k-2} = \binom{8}{2} = 28 \).
  - Monochromatic probability for a single \( K_4 \): \( 2^{1-6} = \frac{1}{32} \).
  - Total \( K_4 \) subgraphs in \( K_{10} \): \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).
  - Expected number:
    \[
    \mathbb{E} = 210 \cdot \frac{1}{32} = 6.5625.
    \]
- In this case, the inequality does not hold, so a valid coloring may not exist.
