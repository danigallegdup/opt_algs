### Solution for Question 1: Lovász Local Lemma (Symmetric Form)

---

#### **Problem Restatement**
Let \( n \) events \( A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n \) satisfy:
1. \( P(A_i) \leq p \) for all \( i \),
2. Each \( A_i \) is independent of all but at most \( d \) other events.

Prove that if \( ep(d+1) \leq 1 \), there exists a nonzero probability that none of the events \( A_i \) occur.

#### **Solution**

### **1. Statement of the Symmetric Lovász Local Lemma (LLL)**
The symmetric LLL states:
- For \( n \) events \( A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n \):
  - If \( P(A_i) \leq p \) for all \( i \), and
  - Each event \( A_i \) is dependent on at most \( d \) other events,
  - Then, if:
    \[
    ep(d+1) \leq 1,
    \]
    there exists a nonzero probability that none of the events \( A_i \) occur simultaneously.

---

### **2. Key Steps in Proof**

#### **Step 1: Dependency Graph Representation**
- Represent dependencies between events using a graph \( G \), where:
  - Each event \( A_i \) is a node.
  - An edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding events depend on each other.
- The maximum degree of any node in \( G \) is \( d \).

#### **Step 2: Probability Bounds**
- Each event \( A_i \) has \( P(A_i) \leq p \).
- Dependencies ensure that \( A_i \) is independent of all events except at most \( d \) others.

#### **Step 3: Application of LLL**
- Define \( x = P(\text{None of the } A_i \text{ occur}) \).
- Using the probabilistic method:
  - If \( ep(d+1) \leq 1 \), the LLL guarantees that \( x > 0 \), meaning there exists at least one configuration where none of the \( A_i \) occur.

---

### **3. Intuition Behind the LLL Condition**
- The condition \( ep(d+1) \leq 1 \) ensures that:
  - The probability of an event \( A_i \) occurring is small enough to offset the dependencies with other events.
  - Each event contributes minimally to the total dependency structure, maintaining the feasibility of avoiding all \( A_i \).

---

### **4. Proof Outline**
1. **Initialization**:
   - Assign probabilities to events \( A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n \).
2. **Dependency Reduction**:
   - Ensure each event \( A_i \) interacts only with a limited number (\( d \)) of other events.
3. **Recursive Probability Bound**:
   - Compute the probability that \( A_i \) occurs given that other dependent events \( A_j \) do not occur.
   - Recursive calculations show that the overall probability remains bounded under the \( ep(d+1) \leq 1 \) condition.

---

### **5. Example**
#### **Setup**:
- \( n = 5 \), \( p = 0.1 \), \( d = 3 \).
- Check if \( ep(d+1) \leq 1 \):
  \[
  e \cdot 0.1 \cdot (3+1) = 0.4 \leq 1.
  \]
- Result:
  - The condition is satisfied.
  - There exists a positive probability that none of the events \( A_i \) occur.
